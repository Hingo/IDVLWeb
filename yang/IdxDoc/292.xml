it wasn't quite sure what i wanted to do you_have said oh i decided to go into a king because he really wanted to keep humans mcdowell and left that meeting i i love this whole noise full body acts of treating this cake breath this is the man claimed that the world's first kicked out of_a hat noise clients can rise they're not just buying kate number five off the shelf but that really commissioning a piece of art where i don't think anyone in his or her right mind would span noise twenty hours making flowers that are going to go on just one section one fraction of the cake you know i'll wake up in the middle of the night and you know i would be short of breath and i would think i can go back to the kitchen because i just thought of breath what i have to do a lot of clients aren't as easily or those slain comes to describe a you're perfect noise cake hispanics sell a lot of times i'll ask the key word since braces for this cake was i slammed into maine breath and filler noise they also said you know we want the wedding that you were what happened breath and so filler that gives me an idea that it's it's going to feel quarrel but also at g. we're creating cakes breath is for d. n. a. process to the happens he'd really have to kind of allow the product to turn a breeze noise it's on life noise the cakes must be eaten we put so much effort into there that taste the texture of a cake breath and he would be really missing you know fifty percent of the product and don't actually taste the case noise it breaks my heart when men noise i_have something noise so beautiful in mine after talking to a client and then meet jesse want a big plane noise breath noise whether it's breath filler because of you know noise budget constraints for noise lack of imagination filler noise it does break and breaks my heart even more when they don't eat the cake because they can't have it noise noise noise noise noise when i think as a person kate i think of noise filler noise i think gaps funds so when you press it it just goes right back to form but it's late it's not god's but at the same time it's the perfect consistency for shaping breath because when we cut into a key noise we don't have crumbs falling all over the place that can actually not eason take far noise i discovered is really at the check take far tends to be noise just a_little too delicate noise and the cakes turn out to a_little bit more firm in what pat noise breath and i'm looking for a bit later for fear noise all right noise yeltsin had noise he's really great custom meat of it is a man in florida and that_is from breath and i told him basically noise the exact temperature right bake tat that consistency of the cake the materials and equipment and ingredient thank generally is breath filler breath i even sentence him pools of my cakes so that he can noise see that this is exactly what i'm looking for and i will settle for anything last each eight of these independent sheeting quayle's better above and

know if she wanted chocolate cake he can get tap noise have a greens kicks they can get chocolate at your wedding but also i think that people are steering away from noise you know the plastic

same for a year later and i think anything will taste the same frozen for a year noise we don't know noise noise noise we need generally has whatever gephardt's plus the cake is the stumbled noise that staying there and it's not can get separated again breath so filler most of our takes are not really finished intel wheat noise get to the actual location we do all the details they're always thing repair kit so that's the breath extra flowers and we just basically the place of powers over the little scraps noise the tears and a serving staff noise but generally know so that the industry standard way of cutting mcquay can noise it's generally about i think i would say an inch thick noise per person breath in it be about four inches tall that take place this sound noise would be breath

think he's noise music noise yeah you're right well noise noise noise noise noise noise noise i can't make lessons for all kinds of different noise you know special requirements will try to accommodate almost everything except noise if it really affects the body of the cake noise and i can't noise she act so for example in beating cake which is what's so done because there really is noise nothing that i can use to farai to_make it fluffy noise that_i would never be able to really sheet that you can take it would just have to be a balance it would have to be noise here's a noun

generally know so that the industry standard way of cutting mcquay can noise it's generally about i think i would say an inch thick noise per person breath in it be about four inches tall that take

want_to slice of insists on it noise i think he's noise music noise yeah you're right well noise noise noise noise noise noise noise i can't make lessons for all kinds of different noise you know special requirements will try to accommodate almost everything except noise if it really affects the body of the cake noise and i can't noise she act so for example in beating cake which is what's so done because there really is noise noise noise noise noise music noise i ain't began making cakes noise because of my love for art and went to art school in new york school of visual arts and breath after that i noise it wasn't quite sure what i wanted to do you_have said oh i decided to go into a king because he really wanted to keep humans mcdowell and left that meeting i i love this whole noise full body acts of treating this cake breath this is the man claimed that the world's first kicked out of_a hat noise clients can rise they're not just buying kate number five off the shelf but that really commissioning a piece of art where i don't think anyone in his or her right mind would span noise twenty hours making flowers that are going to go on just one section one fraction of the cake you know i'll wake up in the middle of the night and you know i would be short of breath and i would think i can go back to the kitchen because i just thought of breath what i have to do a lot of clients aren't as easily or those slain comes to describe a you're perfect noise cake hispanics sell a lot of times i'll ask the key word since braces for this cake was i slammed into maine breath and filler noise they also said you know we want the wedding that you were what happened breath and so filler that gives me an idea that it's it's going to feel quarrel but also at g. we're creating cakes breath is for d. n. a. process to the happens he'd really have to kind of allow the product to turn a breeze noise it's on life noise the cakes must be eaten we put so much effort into there that taste the texture of a cake breath and he would be really missing you know fifty percent of the product and don't actually taste the case noise it breaks my heart when men noise i_have something noise so beautiful in mine after talking to a client and then meet jesse want a big plane noise breath noise whether it's breath filler because of you know noise budget constraints for noise lack of imagination filler noise it does break and breaks my heart even more when they don't eat the cake because they can't have it noise noise noise noise noise when i think as a person kate i think of noise filler noise i think gaps funds so when you press it it just goes right back to form but it's late it's not god's but at the same time it's the perfect consistency for shaping breath because when we cut into a key noise we don't have crumbs falling all over the place that can actually not eason take far noise i discovered is really at the check take far tends to be noise just a_little too delicate noise and the cakes turn out to a_little bit more firm in what pat noise breath and i'm looking for a bit later for fear noise all right noise yeltsin had noise he's really great custom meat of it is a man in florida and that_is from breath and i told him basically noise the exact temperature right bake tat that consistency of the cake the materials and equipment and ingredient thank
