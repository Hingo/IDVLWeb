<field name="asr">noise music noise my name's can have an instructor with personal fitness trainer program that made so first love or actually changing the tube inside the tire and then i'll go over inflating it before we take up the will we need to undo the brakes with a_little quick release of attachment there breath but just takes a_little easier to get that the tire and real outside of that forks noise then we just under the quick release noise and the real will drop out noise now we have the tire noise breath and we'll away from the bike so we'll just work around noise and usually you can just pop the tire right off of that breath often that we have to noise noise pop field to vote noise to find if there is a whole it is just one little air in the tube noise and see if we can hear it noise noise they're all right this tube there doesn't seem to be a yearly keeps coming out so we probably assume that it's just a matter of time but we had written advice that caused us noise there_is as to leave the tubes noise so one would put the two back can noise we leave a_little bit and there had to just so he gives it some form noise noise who put the tire back on to the rams noise but only half of that noise we'll put the other half on after we put there in in grafton the tube would put the tube and noise start by taking the valves noise and placing the valve noise into the hole on the ramp noise noise and then topped that to you noise into the tire breath at this point you might want to have a lock and just make sure that the valves down is in line with the spokes pointing straight down breath and not adding any of it a bit of an ankle noise now we need to inflate the tire noise so the first thing we need to do noise is find out how much pressure to put in the tire all these cars will be stamped with that pressure measurement noise breath and in this case it's a minimum fifty five to ninety five pounds per square inch noise so what what the maximum in on this one noise because we do right primarily on the roads noise now put the tire tack on to the writ onto the bike frame noise so basically it's just the reverse order of what we did before noise we put the wheel and to the forbes noise and take it up when we do put the wheel and make sure they are pushing up on both sides and just have a_look down the fork and make sure the willis sitting in the middle noise it's not off to one side noise and again you have the breaks scream a couple times make sure there's no running noise and you're going to go noise noise noise music noise my name's can
