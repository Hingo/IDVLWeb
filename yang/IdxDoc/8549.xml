said and only when all of this society and i can rule me breath we'll have that car noise since i'm just sitting here breath i thought i might answer some of your questions jane one he asked about noise these cans i'm using that cans for two different noise playing with noise breath one if i'm sort of taking off and wanted to create a line i have the idea in mind noise breath what i want the line can be breath i just put his appearance noise so i'll follow along most pins i don't like marking it with pencil that makes it a little too to be breath noise i think you have to deal with removing the pencil lines noise when the famous closer jo cunningham looked at noise some of my granite is quayle's defense theme that full are noise let's pencil marks noise he wanted to find out where that she had played it say breath we're gone for_the he's a passionate they're o. k. at pre cooking interesting because he breath comes from a very classic tradition where breath this classic closing it's really beautiful noise i think he did breath and_a handsome marks on this breath so i use it used to noise helping our caroline breath you may wonder why you have_been seen my left hand fed noise breath i left on this busy work underneath noise breath i'll do a video eventually of the left hand breath but if_i detect underneath there noise yes noise some things slipping or by gene or whatever i can noise temporarily just to stabilize it noise they'll be two asks two questions noise each of which has dynamic answers that are almost complete opposite the least expected question the first one was how can write utilize the creative energy it in his state of stress state sensed ads noise create the channel will start to create candy if i_am disturbed about something or something is preying on my mind but not the new mediate sit tight noise right and paul are painting a picture coming something creative the state as stress doesn't mean that you can't create this data stress is giving you the material for creation yet last cannot be created with the deadlines deadlines kill creativity noise that's just simple if there is a deadline effective that means i'm locked into what time i think the responsibility on locked into what i think i ought to give a_little noise it was the creative energy so no i can't noise and this makes it impossible flop house trudeau noise but you love that name noise but she tells people she's an artist thereafter noise two questions the first one is do you have kids noise assuming of course noise she couldn't possibly have kids and be an artist noise or she got_a some sort of wonder woman noise yeah yeah noise did she sell her art noise well how many noise music i'm never going_to ask any question noise if i'm an anti gallery help me breath and their party a cocktail party breath a social situation where you meeting people breath and they're asking questions noise are you getting to know people noise music and_then we're asked breath when i do noise i have to the point i never volunteer skater and asked if they don't get it noise sex symbol noise three year long project passing that's in me and i mean i did successfully passes a man noise mhm noise noise no i was in constant noise i i was doing it over a period of several years noise i want_to define our orders noise what was different noise but we're men experiencing different home noise breath when breath noise people ask men all the time what they do noise that was the first time wholly in and that was the greatest breath noise upon being introduced to somebody what i did noise that i was just thought well let's be because there is to me breath we're in noise all right music doing anything interesting noise breath and must be just mother's housewives noise music they could have just been getting a book published on quantum physics breath which could be perfectly possible to then never they never breath occur to anybody so you did you know absolutely do breath noise yeah we're closing noise it's not traditionally done like this noise breath one person alone noise it wasn't social noise okay noise you shouldn't get the idea that noise this represents traditional noise quilt making noise because quote team noise by the time you get to this day which noise the handed quote and stage noise this was done by groups noise usually church groups noise my grandmother's church noise did that noise breath when i wake may breath their roles here noise who else noise the p. c. r. breath that breath filler craft that still leaves me breath it's less traditional noise no i had it your way out whatever it is on a familiar classic designs out of them all noise but when they had the top completed noise they should be armor noise the waiting list noise you have noise breath yeah yeah noise circle of this very often cologne noise this circle the globe the circle at the church noise would you noise it would be your turn noise everything that_he would quilt on you were clout noise so it didn't take long noise i'm sometimes failing that one morning one day a week but if you guys noise ten women's clothing of winds noise talking at once to go_to see noise goes with you music yes music that's why i prefer doing if you don't know noise breath if i want to talk to anybody noise i just talked to you noise i don't have to be seen to you noise and so selfish noise you're quoting clubs here noise in san francisco to parted noise that churches and i've been told that those women haven't rather are all very well traveled women and that much more sophisticated conversation perhaps noise breath than filler breath my grandmother's noise circle hat which doesn't necessarily mean it noise but the entire system noise i think it quite noise when we can meditate aspect noise breath i i listening to books on p noise breath i like breath this in two noise the radio noise breath i noise you arrest someone to find out where the indians noise come on stage when canyon because you want proof music it's carrying ron clenched noise senator noise breath get a lot of attention noise it made it all there noise well i mean
