<field name="asr">noise breath yes well what itself breath but as the donated blurred the canadian border servers through natural resources canada noise filler and noise breath was part of filler old growth forest preserve breath upheld don't work breath so breath noise breath until they had two thirty to forty noise this breath then breath the thing that makes the work procession or what if he breath this is filler breath noise probably the one or two thirds of the diameter of the law but i started out with a four foot of snow noise breath work harder than old growth breath filler breath force preserved noise north of ten broke in algonquin part noise breath and the blew down and the tornado or noise the storm noise noise noise you know part of the deal was that at least in my mind noise what if noise i use this word breath it's just work for something special breath but what i they're breath they're going to work through it that we're poor nation breath and told them that i would tell me breath filler noise occurred breath there are more poverty street can't think of that property history perot and breath filler it helps to put forward on the table and breakfasts breath filler in school breath says that breath some_of the four first ladies should remove her first noise breath ted breath noise noise noise noise noise noise so at what point noise normally that would that would be you lose noise i_would be noise western right here noise i like covering the white pine a lot more than make like car we knew we had here breath because of the way that would respond so they have here is very noise filler breath force noise they have to have extremely sharp tools of world that birds it didn't look that up noise where is quite high and there's a_little bit more plausible there's more plastic late noise and it's easier to the consumer is moved cut noise colors are a lot different as well noise so there's a_lot more there's a_lot of noise i think a lot more difference of contrasts noise in just a word that hope for the south what that or is it noise suitor noise so it's noise becomes a little bit more dramatically you can use the noise the graying breath in the words to highlight the movement noise in certain areas especially noise where you've got college where is running out noise like contours noise around the allies noise noise like that noise the cullen keeps circuses as well noise the style of car ring noise is based upon the west coast style and i think formally studied noise both the child there breath and then discuss style noise and when i was going to art school had the good fortune of hanging out around bill reached studio o. and living close to robert davis and getting there on the weekends noise so of the height of style with a very significant imports as well because of those two characters noise so what i've done noise yeah noise i did not use noise the traditional northwest coast style and adapt to that noise filler so that it was my own signature style noise breath and there wouldn't be confused noise breath where if anybody carving on the west noise so all what i'm doing here noise is that cake and an adopted west coast harding style noise where there_is noise and each during the quake noise filler filler or eastern wait high noise and i'm telling the story then and killing noise yeah noise dan proportionate to the west coast style noise but i'm using a cream vengeance noise breath and the creamy legend noise it is noise my background noise so my grandmother was breath the noise noise i mean you had changed the area noise so i use of traditional cree legend noise breath now the legend itself noise is this story breath filler of noise noise o. k. noise medicine than in the tree noise so the net a medicine man noise was cast by its spell into the tree permission admit noise for carrying on noise let let's just say it was carrying on the black car noise and the punishment noise it was put into the tree was tapped into the tree noise and the young woman comes along one day gathering firewood and chopping up firewood noise and breath chops open or chops down this tree you know to bring this little medicine man noise and so she take them back to the filler to the village and becomes part_of her household noise breath and through his black art noise he gets or pregnant noise and nobody can figure out where she certainly can't figure out how she would become plague noise her father get so upset noise and she doesn't know she can explain it noise she doesn't know anything about what this little medicine man is noise and so we're father confused if not telling the truth so he assembles all men in the village noise breath now the owl say here noise it is in all honesty your troops character noise breath and breath at a guardian of sorts to the woman's about powell is always keeping an eye on the woman when she travels in the woods seattle is not far off noise breath now the battle has worked noise it's a_little medicine man noise so there are higher genes noise breath and when it comes to breath everyone is denying it nobody knows anything about it noise and one eighth noise to the medicine man noise he begins to denied as well noise so we're seeing is that powell noise perched up on the wall noise breath filler here is his denial noise the cow wolf noise senator noise and that's noise is forcing them to to be honest noise so he's drawing attention to that noise yeah noise the filler medicine man is lying noise and the medicine man tells the truth noise the father forced him into marriage noise but before then there's the noise filler the name is all but struck because she doesn't want to marry this little to work character noise so the sherman comes up with a solution noise filler noise putting that dwarf men is shaking can't noise and the shaking can't allows the transformation noise into the spirit world noise so from animal to spirit to human the shaky chances were that can take place noise so he goes into the shaking can't noise and in the shaking can't ceremony noise the man undergoes the dwarf man undergoes a transformation noise and comes out of the shaking can't transform noise in two filler breath full sized handsome noise young brains noise breath they get married and live happily ever after noise so here's the call noise fitting perch noise on the woman's head noise the woman just hung noise coach noise filler over top on the head of the abortion ban noise breath and that puns are usually think of buying noise the light skinned noise filler that the transformation of energy from noise one animals geared to noise but now there noise or on the animal to human or human to spirit world noise so there's that three elements in this transformation in the world noise breath one is the spirit world one is natural world and the others the human world noise breath and a lot of times at home would signify noise the transference of spirit from one figure to another noise </field>
