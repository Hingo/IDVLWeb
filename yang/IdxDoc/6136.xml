<field name="asr">they're reading the_other half share with the theme that on my mind that is i mean when there was noise and then gary than the other room beds they divided right it will right here you can see that really hit into them and the polar rumors breath ha ha noise what noise noise noise that firing me for noise noise noise okay good noise good noise noise noise very scary there's the fear of iran are in any noise our pilot guy noise i can't tell that if you will get to that won't be noise yeah yeah yeah noise all_right that breath that noise that you felt that that you didn't think she inherited that know that stuff do you plan to just be for her up noise these things will be here but i mean really that just you'd read these things on a regular guest noise so i mean if you had told me once tarred by ruby you're suppose to do with instruments noise noise noise mhm noise eleven noise noise noise mhm noise noise you elect them noise yeah noise noise and noise noise there are very gentle very serious noise very easy to get noise well the bigger sounds all well noise it's i mean you either virus force a vote of the projects i changed to trash and breath filler was the sound of it noise breath and found and really noise they resonating breath had founded as_a really big lush found noise well it really does feel like an actual instrument and actual violent when i'm playing and filler noise when i came in here a kind of of the expectation is in this and really to me in really big but filler noise and i'm surprised how well the responded to king's i. d. a. with my bow noise state responds like a real instrument noise so noise you know i i think there is wrong noise a growing trend and he is more acceptance noise what the current five of those noise can sell up to the people call me and asked me noise and so all of this growing acceptance of it and you know to do the same way with the with the instrument of_this noise breath i think people want_to have it had nothing in there you need to prove serenity noise filler i think there would be demand for it because filler filler noise as for like this could take a beating noise and i'm not sure how a response to things like humidity and that temperature noise but as you know a wooden instrument noise umm should things like commending and temperature really affected tuning in that noise they just can't take you know of playing in the rain or something noise at the but something like this could really be used in situations like outdoor concerts mania noise all_right noise like stealing or what happened breath that is really right and then be in that noise i think that breath i get back to take into account of the breath i mean breath you know and this noise you'd have_to carry it differently than you would in a mobile and because of the weight noise filler breath you mean breath pena how that would affect how they affect your performance noise but it did noise and like how light it and maybe left and the night is really going to play all i can noise umm i was messy around a little bit just filler am tracy up close a play of the bridge noise filler how responded in the higher registers of the string noise and filler it kept up noise basically noise filler i'm just really impressed with this noise i mean i'm i'm actually really amazed by what you would you produced here noise and i really think it has a future noise okay noise good noise good noise noise noise breath do you remember noise where was that all noise i'd do it's breath could do did them noise </field>
