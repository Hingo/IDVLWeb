<field name="asr">noise because it's the last christmas chapel ahmed thought right a day noise actually prepare like a fool out thurmond noise i would just kind of them noise we have some thoughts that i had it down noise peace noise that's something that we commonly noise talk about on doing christmas to put on cards and everything so noise breath i was reflecting literally on the filler breath the peace of god noise as we're talking about noise character attributes breath of god this year noise and so breath i was going_to read noise all_right noise this bit of these thoughts and_that kind of put down noise on paper just to reflect noise so noise it was christmas eve december twenty fourth nineteen fourteen noise german troops on the western front begin to decorate their trench is in spite of them miserable conditions noise candles were placed on trees noise and the sound of german carole scene jeff did over no man's land noise the ears of the opposing british forces noise surprisingly english perils seem them boarded the germans in reply noise eventual invitations were sentence in both german and british sit stood side by side on the battlefield noise exchanging gifts of whiskey noise chocolate is cigars noise each side was a lot together they're dead that give proper burials for them all noise breath and then talk of where the exchange and dresses and some even played football together noise it seems other words the preacher the queasy asked he still held trio breath for everything there is a season and a time for everything that happened noise it's the kind of mountain noise breath the time the feet noise the time for war and a time for peace noise the christmas always seems to have that universal theme peace on earth good will towards men noise breath some are so mad dash is is to promote this far at all times and not just on christmas for instance noise on a summer sites within israel noise as myself and two friends are about to enter our hotel noise you're stopped by a woman in a flowing dress with the spirit to match noise bless this bright eyed noise join together in the western wall the hold hands and unite for peace in the middle east noise we thought and_i suggest you're breath we also been walking in the heat all day long and various piles of dirt breath and decided we call it a night noise but the christmas season approaches i'd been thinking about this concept of peace and i was viewed from various binge noise breath what is peace to people noise breath for the soldiers fighting world war one it was a cease fire noise the woman flowing dress that was holding hands and uniting under something noise that a comfortable middle class family and his security and the rest for the lower class forgot need is food from somewhere noise for the feuding couple is agreement for the american consumer is silence noise for the old and dying and his rest noise my question is yes noise what does peace to god noise peace like other words such as purity cleanliness or stability noise can you describe as the absence of something noise as purity is the absence of the file meant from cleanliness the absence of filth the stability breath the absence of chaos so is peace noise the absence of contention noise breath what then does everyone's pursuit of peace noise indicate a matter of cells noise it indicates that humanity is in bondage to conflict noise and in slave by turmoil noise breath what the pursuit of peace reveals about man noise and that he is disturbed noise out of joint and thoroughly backwards noise breath we are now the antithesis breath of god's creative declaration in which he said breath all that i've made is very good noise breath what he has made has turned very bad noise they're never ending and never satisfied pursuit of peace noise is evidence of just noise yeah noise breath we know a faithful gracious god noise breath for the sake of his own gory was not content noise simply start over noise for to us a child is born breath to us the sun that is given noise breath and the government should be appointed shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor noise might he taught noise everlasting father prince of noise thanks noise how ironic it is noise and the baby born to be the prince of peace noise but the life breath that breath i_was could be characterized as nothing breath of the sort noise breath from the moment jesus of nazareth was born breath those in authority were in pursuit of his life noise it was a refugee in egypt noise breath he was a poor carpenter in nasser noise breath he was homeless the indelibly breath he was a controversial rabbi in today noise it was a marked man by the religious leaders breath he was a desperate child the guard noise it was a falsely accuse convicted and executed political insurrection missed noise he was the mock or re and shame noise of all jerusalem as breath the harold king of the jews noise a peaceful life houston noise not even close noise at least not by our standards noise breath in the eyes of god there was no man who lived more peace noise the lord jesus christ noise he was the only man whose life noise breath more and to dogs created declaration breath this is my son became who breath i and well please noise he was not the stared noise out of joint breath and backwards like the race to which he came noise breath he was the only display of god's perfection breath the world has ever known breath and because of its broken this noise breath the world found peace breath only by removing him from their met noise we'd like to look at knowledge percent perspective of peace noise we have no further than the look at his son noise and i say nine six noise breath the messiah is beamed at princeton shallow noise shalom as we know is not simply just peace corps noise austerity noise it is a complete mess noise wholeness noise fullness breath the right missed and harmony noise breath with died breath and what he originally intended noise and what he originally intended noise it was a selfless worship filled humanity noise who sought out what it was to fully loans breath and be fully locked noise why do so many noise we'll have so much really have so little peace noise sure we my on christmas cards peace and still onto stones rest in peace breath but there's one thing certain about humanity breath is that we are truly void of god's peace noise the piece that comes from dying to self noise the piece which comes from abandoning oneself noise to pursue the joy noise of other human beings noise think about it noise think about what goes on breath even subconsciously in your mind noise on a daily basis noise how much comparing of yourself noise others do you do noise she got a better grade than me noise i must be awfully noise why would a happy noise but if i'm not happy about it noise okay but i'm not wearing that noise he is pretty humble noise i think others think of me as humble too right noise not only do we endlessly compare ourselves one another breath but we prophetic we presume on the character of others to make us feel back much better about herself noise you see where she looked at me what's wrong noise now that i've seen you he hang out with i don't think he cares about not very much noise they don't really care about me that they did they would act more noise do you hear what she said noise police noise we are of little children breath stomping around the playgrounds stealing toys and saying not breath noise we just a_little more surface noise governor noise ourself as pursuit of promotion breath can be wrapped in a mild casting noise serious spiritual dialogue or even the excuse that hey it's just not personality noise but what we reveal is that we are hollow shells noise but the life intended by dodd breath a life of true noise how is it than that breath that peace of god we surpasses breath all understanding bogart our hearts breath in our minds noise in the christ jesus noise in christ jesus breath we have the basis for peace noise as romans five one says therefore breath since we have been justified by faith we have peace with gone noise for the lord jesus christ noise hello noise we heard it wednesday noise the collections one noise supporting him noise all the fullness of god was priesthood well breath and through him to reconcile to himself all things weather on earth or to_have in breath making peace noise breath when the blood noise but his co noise well the substitution area told me of the perfect sun breath satisfied the just wrath of the holy gone thus making peace between god and man noise breath the way to true peace here on earth is found exempt to find breath in the character noise of the tone that noise the reason christ is life noise is peace is jewelry noise is because he is breath all got intended man to be comprehensively selfless noise full of worship noise eager to put the interests of others breath the for himself noise he was truly the prince of noise making peace between god and man noise and showing his own character to be the way to true peace noise well the soldiers the next day went back to fighting noise holding hands let the middle east saying noise security only lasts as long as your life noise mansion not live by bread alone noise agreements will be and can be broken noise consumers and can't be silence the less you know jesus christ noise dying is anything but peaceful noise he walked through peace noise over the holidays noise my voice use this noise whoever finds his life will lose it noise and whoever this is his life for my sake noise we'll find it noise let's pray yes noise possibly bank comes up noise some more music noise from there noise we take this time to humble ourselves before you noise we praise you we exile your name noise for how you have glorified yourself noise glorifying your son noise in coming to us breath in rescuing us been delivering us noise not only from breath the bondage of seeing that noise and the penalty which is separation from you noise breath well you know saved us from ourselves noise but i pray for this university noise i for myself noise the faculty noise yeah noise breath well this season you would be constantly cream mary noise constantly feeding us noise breath from filler our car seat breath of our own pleasure and our own glory apart from you noise i pray that the true noise keith that surpasses all understanding noise would be given to bust through your gracious hand noise as a gift noise but we might in july noise the lighting and others rather than ourselves noise that we might find peace noise in casting off our own desires noise and taking on the desires of others as warmth noise when i pray for that kind of peace the peace noise that puts a myself noise we're not afraid to judy please with the songs noise we thank you so much noise for what you've done in christ for us noise and i pray that you would continually break our hearts noise to what break shores noise to make is truly creatures were not backwards any longer noise but bob's right noise right yes noise following heart after your ways noise and the lighting noise we thank you we pray all these things for christ noise breath his name noise because of_his blood noise tonight noise </field>
