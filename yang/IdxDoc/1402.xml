<field name="asr">noise hello and today i want to talk about it noise conversation everyday talk noise and of course eminent talk about it in the noise business and professional environment not in every day breath social breath conversation noise filler and and as soon as that breath this conversation that we're talking about breath filler takes place breath filler in a business and professional context breath but also probably between equals in the work environment noise breath filler or with his superior noise and i think it's not a bad idea to have the same standard of for both of you noise if you're directing the activity breath of people under you the years supervising noise many of the things we'll applaud that breath that_is not precisely what noise i've tried to noise focus noise was there by talking about some basic goal she should have your conversation breath in your inner personal breath filler communication breath we're talking about communicating with an individual or two maybe three people breath filler at wants breath and breath there is some basic goals that you could keep in mind noise but in trying to make your conversations in your inner personal breath filler communication breath were affected noise these are not easy goals they take some time and some effort at some focus breath but i think breath by keeping these ideas in line and tried to maintain breath the this orientation breath you can really improve your breath conversational inter personal communication noise first noise that you want to focus on description that evaluation noise in talking to people breath you want communication noise breath filler you told one of the breath the saudi waiting other people you want to be exchanging information breath telling people what to think and what should now breath filler you know breath and you want to indication noise you know what the professor's do about the grades are breath filler we'll let the breath of workers value it is of value it to work breath now you don't necessarily want to do that noise i think he could be a real problem if_you are too ready to exhibit disapproval breath filler something that that people have done breath i think that should be done in a different setting breath in a more formal way breath filler with some warning breath but breath filler you know i i think you don't want to be too quick with breath disapprove noise describe it noise the the things you see breath describe what's happening breath but don't necessarily if value way say that breath for a different situation noise breath so i did breath that you want to be concerned about problems solved noise not control noise about problems that noise you want to solve problems that's the most important thing in the work environment breath it's the work and support is the task breath it's getting the job noise not necessarily breath filler as important is you know establishing the pecking order or as doubt wishing them breath you're the one who's in charge or breath that breath you know you're the one who knows loans through something like that noise breath that may make you feel good in the short term breath but it doesn't help your communication patterns of other people breath and it doesn't really help them breath the job that you want_to focus on noise problem solved noise other people have needs and concerns breath you have needs and concerns breath you may have resources breath they have resources breath filler and breath you serve them by giving them opportunities suggesting ideas breath you don't want to be hurting people breath like cattle noise you don't want to be breath trying to get people to which he wore breath you want to be always focused on breath solving the problem and when other people breath you know trying to indicate that they want to control things breath don't be afraid to suggest that well look if we just solve the problem if we just noise do our work effectively breath we'll all be better off so breath second focus and problem solving breath that control noise sorry noise dreaded be spontaneous noise not to strategic noise got to be spontaneous not to strategic noise each interaction is there for each person is different noise and you want to be spontaneous in your reaction to the person in this situation noise have ideas have impressions but don't have one set strategy noise don't decide before conversation art breath is the strategy of many use breath this is live and_they have won it breath this is what i want_to get that need to be breath more noise a more flexible than that breath you need to be open to the idea that things won't change breath filler and be different even if you do breath have a strategy breath try to see ms. spontaneous as possible breath and be willing to adjust breath and change breath that that that that strategy react breath to what's happening though just continue on breath with the course breath the new set all right noise fourth noise and that the show and that the two words those are right noise you want people to think that you_are on their saw if they're expressing breath that they have problems breath you should be concerned with that you should you should express breath that you understand how they feel and what they may be going through it is very important breath to give people the impression that you're on years you're on their side breath you could identify with their situation breath and you try to help that noise you people breath have feelings recognize that they have those feels show that you appreciate those feelings breath show people that_you care about them noise you want noise to build a feeling of comrade ship in the workplace noise in your professional involved noise now just noise i am until i am a computer breath i do know people are attracted noise to that noise people want_to think that your breath that the your concerned about them breath and you_are on their side breath this'll make them breath were concerned about you breath it will make them more open towards you breath it will make them more tolerant towards you noise try to show and that the the situation that other people or noise they have then finally you want to have a rat i'll read a a a a representation of yourself breath as an equal to that noise you don't want_to try to be establishing breath your superior noise as i said the goal of the work in professional environment is to get the task there noise that to establish some kind_of pecking order breath some kind_of social hierarchy noise do you why breath they indicate that you are working together breath and the best way to indicate working together breath is to indicated equal relationship noise it is you don't have noise necessarily an equal relationship breath maybe you get paid more or maybe you have more responsibility or whatever breath that doesn't mean breath that you don't want to indicate to them breath that breath you are likes the breath that you're a team player that you appreciate that noise don't try to come across as you're the expert and they're the anew noise you are jesse and the other person noise you're very much like that noise you may have more information you may have you know different ideas but you're still does the person breath white them trying to do a job noise and while they knew that breath noise salinas scars ain't sorry there's an effort by review breath that doesn't mean that you don't want to noise focus on how they are noise the same in many important life noise so those are noise five goals that you should try to achieve noise in your conversations noise you want_to have description not evaluation noise you want to have breath problem solving not control noise you want to have sponsored eighty breath not strategy and you want it you want to have breath and that's the best neutrality and you want to have the quality noise some to noise noise let's talk about some things to keep in mind for creating conversations that noise granting conversations that were noise or is there want to say is that you need to use your listing guidelines noise we need to use less than that noise all your conversations all your inner personal communications will be and yet breath if you're perceived as being a good listener breath if you get the maximum breath out of your conversations by being able to breath will soar when understand breath what people are saying breath and breath to the extent that people feel that you're less than breath than they are more willing to talk to you breath to share information noise use breath be a good listener breath and it will help make people want to talk to you breath in a meaningful way noise there are people out noise don't interrupt to let them finish noise breath filler i know that it's filler it it sometimes one year breath in a work environment and you try to get things done in your arrive breath he still is someone's not going to the point that really breath it's not very productive noise i especially want to award man breath about the problem of interrupting women that you can be non white is serious problem filler it is you are interrupting filler women breath they are used to that and_they say to listen to them topped let them finish their talking with them and thinks that filler you will be a better off noise breath make sure you're ready to listen to the noise make sure you're ready to_make sure that a susan we are ready to listen to_you when you talk noise don't move noise talk to someone and lest you think they're ready to listen to noise right breath and usually that means that they have completed talking breath that you know they have gotten breath there's side out breath and that it's time for yourself noise i think that can make things work much better when they have spoken their piece noise and then there is applause and then they're ready to listen the u. n. breath that it's time for you to talk noise if you get a word in edgewise sir you interrupt filler breath or something like that noise that doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to listen to noise doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to understand breath what what what you're saying it will be attending to a call noise on thursday to put them in a position to want_to listen to_you than you can talk then you can get something that's so breath i was talking about information giving it a conversation breath filler and try to figure out what people want and what they need breath and then trying to provide them with what they want and what they need that they'll be afraid to senate paraphrase what they're saying to you if you're not exactly sure what someone is asking you for or what you think someone needs then you can say sell you'll want to know noise so you are curious about noise so you are concerned about noise don't be afraid to paraphrase rather than don understanding what they're saying breath you can't paraphrase what what they're saying and that will provide all the way for u. n. breath to breath try to make sure that you're hearing here giving the right breath filler in the information breath don't cast what they're saying noise when your unsure noise fine noise i don't noise what_are possible breath and people asking for information breath try to give options noise don't try to say okay here's the here's here's the definitive ins noise don't be afraid to say something like well there are a_couple of different things we could do breath one of them would be that's another one could be bess breath there are couple of different ways to fly this information breath one of them is over here breath the other one is over there breath get people options that answers breath what does this do this outs in power people breath in a conversation breath they have a choice breath they're taking an active role breath to the extent that breath they feel like they're taking an active role of a conversation breath they're much more likely to be armed meaningful participant noise do you people auctions done this is early the answers noise breath if you did provide some of the information breath what in your giving people information breath when no one came from noise well no the source of the information breath is this for a view breath is this from your experience you find it from someone else breath is that in the work manual was it isn't breath the information that was presented breath with the proposal will or the sales contract or whatever breath tell people the source of the information in breath this will really help boost your credibility breath it's not just i know is that i found out noise it comes from somewhere else and here's what i've got breath it makes you look like you're not breath so opinionated breath with a you use a good and hard information noise don't be afraid to tell people where there's more information noise filler this is a very useful thing noise filler i find it very useful in conversations people are asking me breath and you know i'll say things like well or one of_the mail you the links to that or what i sent you a copy of that correspondents breath you can fall off in a conversation breath with the information breath but that's the the gap noise you know i find it very very noise difficult in a confirmation breath to give the internet lights or read off e. mail address is breath that_is not the appropriate forum for that breath your program farmers at all breath what i say to you that that information or noise send you the wake of this mission and you'll be a lot better off noise o. k. noise self breath when you're giving people information and sharing information with people breath don't be afraid to paraphrase that_he saw what you want to know it is noise and then they'll say yes or no noise you people auctions not answers let people know where you've got this information breath and you know be willing to tell them how they can learn more or get more information breath and you might do that in the context breath that is not necessarily a congress breath noise finally i want_to talk about some basic noise conversation components of_the things you want_to breath keep in mind in things that breath so to make the conversation process breath although easier breath and once again here we're talking about breath conversation a business breath and professional contacts were not necessarily breath filler talk about it breath everyday conversation about your favorite ball team or how your breath problem tomatoes are doing breath we're in a business breath and professional contacts any isn't days breath the filler that that you_are very important for you to keep them all noise here is noise take turns noise take turns listening noise and talking noise breath we should either one role for the filler breath noise when you're less thing noise listen actively noise wait to talk until there's a time for you to tell noise breath until there is an open it noise until they're ready to listen noise right don't be du du du du du du du du du du du du breath bison that electronic hall where match breath that's breath not useful for conversation to be useful breath it needs to be breath to reimpose of sentence it's breath a view needs to be breath extended level breath the special either business and professional breath contact so don't be afraid to take turns listen noise then talk noise they go back to listen noise but no injure others noise filler filler don't be afraid to use their names in conversation this makes things breath seymour prayers of all breath the_first time breath you talk to someone always introduce yourself breath and asked who they are breath and say glad to get to know you breath every first conversation breath should star like betting knowledge others breath you know that they're important that
