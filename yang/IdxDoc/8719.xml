option many will have other options like lower median he levels as well as more dry and less stress settings breath the cycling thermostat is what_is called a blind no thermostat which means it contains two small strips of contact material that lead noise at a particular temperature to opening closed the circuit automatically noise opened means no electricity can pass and close means they can pass freely noise if this only happens at one temperature how can the low in medium temperature settings work noise well as we can see in the wiring diagram models with other temperature options heavy thermostat heater depending on who's setting more or less voltage that's applied to this here noise which is attached to the dryer cycle in service that noise well starting with supplied more voltage creating more heat noise and the mediums setting for the last poll to match generating left noise and high setting that would not energized this there is that heat or at all noise in this way that thermostat is tricked into thinking that the dryer is hotter than it actually is noise it opens at a lower drug temperature noise problems with this system can occur when the temperature selections breath which fails to stem the proper amount of voltage too that the respect here noise or the ear itself fails to keep the thermostat noise this is very rare but it can happen noise our resisted scheck cross that thermostat here might shed some light noise but the heater operas infinite resistant breath meaning it open circuit it will need to be replaced noise it should provide a small amount of resistance to create the heat require noise we can check the entire chain of components responsible for borough operation except the coil noise breath but it's one in the dryer and measuring resistance from the red timer contact to the neutral plug problem which is the right product it's pointed at you for this to work so red timer connection must be disconnected or you may get a false reading their other timer contacts breath the doors which must also be closed noise if you have that disconnected you can still check from the red timer car roll to the blue connection on the door switch noise we can also see that after the black wire leaves the narrator it passes by the motor through the push to start switch noise you only hold this which for a moment noise so how does the drawer continue to run after a while ago you may ask the question noise the symbol to the right for them or is it critical switch meaning noise that when the movers breath is this a trickle portion that spinning action causes contacts to expand out word breaking contact from the start one used and re routing power to the main lines noise if you make connection to the black wire electricity flows through the closed door switch noise finally becoming a white neutral connection noise it didn't complete just passed back through the wall plugged into the two connection in your home service panel noise for this test because the motor is not running you'll need to press breath and hold the push to start switch noise and instead of reading means a break in this circuit noise there you have it the magic to mystified and made clear noise there are few picture dryer breath remember to help others with your newfound knowledge noise i hope this information was helpful noise visit appliances can dot com for more information thank you for watching noise </field>
